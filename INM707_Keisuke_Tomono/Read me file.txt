Read me file:

Task1_to_5.ipynb is the code for the basic task. This is implemented on jupyternotebook. 
Thus, you can run this code at least on jypyter notebook.

Atari_Task9_10.ipynb is the code for the Atari task. 
When you have the error, please follow the comment which I wrote. 
Then, the code will run successfully. This is implemented on google colab. 
Thus, at least on this environment, you can run the codes.

DRL file is the the file contains the codes for the task 7 and 8, and also the date.
If you use this file in your local PC, you might have an error, 
because I implemented the codes and run the codes on google collab. 
Thus, you can successfully run the code. Only my custom environment, 
stock trading market is .py file, This is because I imported this environment to my main script.

Notice: I do not put random seed in any codes. 
Thus, If you re-run my codes, then you may have the different results,
because my agents basically do not perfectly converge.
However, I make sure that I obtain all the results coming from my implemented codes.

Another notice: when you get the error in any codes after running the code, then please
Refer to my comments on the codes. Then, in all codes, you can successfully run all codes!

The data is used for Task 1 to 8, and so you put the data in the right place. For task 7,8, 
You need to download and put the data file in your local PC folder. As for task 1 to 5, you
Should put the data in the same directly of the task1_to_5.ipynb.
